Net::Server::POP3::Skeleton version 1.0
=======================================

This module implements a bare-bones skeleton POP3 server.  It is
intended as a base class.  You should inherit from this class (which,
in turn, inherits from Net::Server::Fork|Net::Server::Fork).  The only
POP3 command implemented by this module is the QUIT command.  All
others should be implemented by your code as methods.

The purpose of this module is for easily creating non-standard POP3
servers in Perl.  If you want a normal POP3 server (ie, one that
simply serves emails from an MBOX or MailDirs file), you would
probably be better off using one of the pre-built, faster C-based
servers.  If, on the other hand, you want to create a specialized POP3
server that, for instance, generates the content of the messages
dynamically based on data from a website, this module is what you
want.
